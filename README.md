Niteru allows you to search for Japanese kanji by inputting a kanji that looks visually similar to the one you're looking for. It's heavily inspired by Lars Yencken's [SimSearch](https://github.com/larsyencken/simsearch) and uses the same stroke-edit distance calculation as that project. It also uses kanji readings and English meanings from [KANJIDIC](http://www.edrdg.org/kanjidic/kanjidic.html).

Niteru's backend is in Scala via the Play framework and its frontend is Typescript with React/Redux.
